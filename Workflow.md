## Git Work Flow

- Daily stand up: should be 15 mins max. You talk about what you did yesterday, what you are going to do today and any blockers in your way.
- Sprint: chunk of time to work on a set amount of tickets
- Team manager: manage the kanban board, git workflow and tickets
- SME: Subject Matter Expert (Front End & Back End)
- Front End SME: team goes to for React questions
- Back End SME: team goes to for Express/MongoDB questions
- Kanban Board: place to organize tickets (Backlog, in progress, peer review, in test, done, blocked; each of these have a 'fast track' space at end of column/row for imminent issues)
